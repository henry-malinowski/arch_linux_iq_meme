To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Arch Linux. The performance are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the GNU + Linux kernal most of the it will go over a typical wiki user's head. There's also journalctl 's objective outlook, which is deftly woven into systemd - its personal philosophy draws heavily from Linus Torvalds, for instance. The powerusers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the user space, to realize that they're not just usefil- they say something deepin about Arch. As a consequence people who dislike Arch Linux truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the utility in crontab'ing sudo pacman -Syyu every 5 minutes. Which itself is a cryptic reference to Debian's aptitude. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Aaron Griffin's genius unfolds itself on their non-i3 screens. What fools... how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚ And yes by the way, I DO have an [Arch Linux tattoo](). And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they don't have a full system upgrade to complete.
